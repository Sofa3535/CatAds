# CatAds

What's the biggest problem with AdBlock? ADS. Sites are getting privy to adblockers, and creating walls until you disable them. That's why I've created this extension to run concurrently with your adblocker. Presenting: CatAds, for when you need ads, but want cats.

This is a simple chrome extension I wrote to see how easy it is to make an extension.
